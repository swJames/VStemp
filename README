VStemp Daemon 1.0 
 
Daemon for controlling the fan speed on Dell Vostro 3560 laptops under linux. 
The daemon should equally well work on Inspiron laptops, as well as any Dell 
laptop that works with i8k. 
 
Requirements: 
 
-lm_sensors 
-i8k 
-python-daemon 
 
Usage 
        /etc/init.d/vstempd start|stop|restart 
 
The default setup as follows: 
 
Fan switches at full power when the highest temperature is reached: 
56.0°C and above 
        The fan will remain at that speed for the following 7 iterations 
        regardless of the measurements taken in that time. If the temperature 
        after that is still above 56.0°C, the process will start over. 
        One iteration is equal to the REFRESHRATE in seconds(config file) 
51.0 - medium speed: 
        This defines the mid-range so anything between 29.0°C and 56.0°C 
        Measurement will be taken each 15 seconds. 
44.0°C - low end: 
        The fan will be kept at medium and will run the same way until 
        it drops 15.0°C below the low temp. 
 
If you would like to change that configuration, edit the /opt/vstemp/config file. 
After that restart the daemon: 
/etc/init.d/vstemp.d restart 

Installation:
Simply run
	./setup
As root.
